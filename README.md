## üìä Retail Store Sales Analysis (2022-2025)

# üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and analyzing a Retail Store Sales Database using MySQL, based on a real-world-like synthetic dataset. The data represents transaction records for a retail company dealing in furniture, electric essentials, food, beverages, and general product supplies spanning data from 2022 to 2025, the project aims to uncover business insights by tracking key metrics such as:

* Product categories and pricing

* Payment methods

* Transaction timestamps

* Sales performance and discounts

The primary goals of this project include:

* Structuring a robust relational database schema

* Cleaning and analyzing large datasets efficiently

* Generating business-critical insights using complex SQL queries

* Applying advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, CTEs, and conditional logic

This end-to-end project demonstrates real-world SQL data analysis skills applicable to roles in data analytics, business intelligence, and database development.

# Customer Transaction Frequency vs Average Spend
* **Insight** : High transaction volume across multiple customers, with modest variations in average total spend.
* **Pattern** : Customer CUST_05, CUST_24, and CUST_08 lead both in transaction count and average spend, marking them as high-value and high-engagement users.

# Average Spend by Payment Method
* **Insight** : Customers who pay by Cash tend to have the highest average spending, followed by Credit Card users, and then Digital Wallet users.
* **Pattern** : **Cash** payments lead with an average total spend above 124.5, suggesting that these transactions might be larger or bulk purchases. **Credit Card** payments follow closely, indicating it‚Äôs a preferred method for moderate to high-value transactions. **Digital Wallets** show the lowest average spend (~122.5), possibly indicating quick, smaller purchases or mobile-first behavior.

# üßÆ SQL Concepts Used

The development of this project, I used various MySQL syntax and functions to manage and analyze the data,including:
                  
                    **CREATE DATABASE**- To create the database structure.
                    
                    **LOAD DATA INFILE**- To load data from external files into the database.
                    
                    **SELECT,FROM** - To retrieve all data from the tables.
                    
                    **AVG,SUM,COUNT**- For calculating average,sum and count for specific fields.
                    
                    **MAX,MIN**- To find the maximum and minimum values in specific fields.
                    
                    **DISTINCT**- To retrieve unique values from dataset table.
                    
                    **ROW_NUMBER(),OVER(),LAG**- Compare data across rows using window functions.
                   
                    **CASE STATEMENT**- This logic condition used to implement within dataset table.
                    
                    **DATE**- To filter data by date,month,year and week.
                    
                    **PERCENTAGE**- To calculate percentages for sales.
                    
                    **LIMIT**- To restrict the number of records by limit.
