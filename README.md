**Project Title: Retail Store Sales Database using MySQL**

This project involves creating a Retail_Store_Sales Database using MySQL. The Database will track essential data points such as Customer details, product category, product price, payment method and date.

**Data Sources**

The dataset **Retail_Store_Sales** used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, a popular platform for datasets.
It contains real-world sales data, which **Retail Store Sales dataset** contains 12,575 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions from a retail store.
I analyzed this data about customer behavior, sales, payment method and product performance.

The development of this project, I used various MySQL syntax and functions to manage and analyze the data,including:
                  
                    **CREATE DATABASE**- To create the database structure.
                    
                    **LOAD DATA INFILE**- To load data from external files into the database.
                    
                    **SELECT,FROM** - To retrieve all data from the tables.
                    
                    **AVG,SUM,COUNT**- For calculating average,sum and count for specific fields.
                    
                    **MAX,MIN**- To find the maximum and minimum values in specific fields.
                    
                    **DISTINCT**- To retrieve unique values from dataset table.
                    
                    **ROW_NUMBER(),OVER(),LAG**- Compare data across rows using window functions.
                   
                    **CASE STATEMENT**- This logic condition used to implement within dataset table.
                    
                    **DATE**- To filter data by date,month,year and week.
                    
                    **PERCENTAGE**- To calculate percentages for sales.
                    
                    **LIMIT**- To restrict the number of records by limit.
